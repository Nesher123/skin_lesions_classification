# Skin Lesions Classification: An Efficient MultiClass Skin Cancer Classification Using Transfer Learning


### üìå Abstract
Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the world, constituting one-third of cancer cases. 
Benign skin cancers are not fatal and can be cured with proper medication.
But it is not the same as malignant skin cancers. 
In the case of malignant melanoma, in its peak stage, the maximum life expectancy is less than or equal to 5 years. 
But, it can be cured if detected in the early stages. 
Though there are numerous clinical procedures, the accuracy of diagnosis falls between 49% to 81% and is time-consuming.
So, dermatoscopy has been brought into the picture. It helped increase the accuracy of diagnosis but could not demolish 
the error-prone behavior. A quick and less error-prone solution is needed to diagnose this majorly growing skin cancer.
This project deals with the usage of deep learning in skin lesion classification. In this project, an automated model 
for skin lesion classification using dermoscopic images is developed with CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) as a 
training model. Convolution neural networks are known for capturing the features of an image. So, they are preferred in 
analyzing medical images to find the characteristics that drive the model toward success.
This work has the potential to assist dermatology specialists in decision-making at critical stages.


### üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
A public dataset from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISCI) archive was obtained for this work known as 
HAM10000. It is quite a large dataset that consists of 10015 samples of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common 
pigmented skin lesions.
